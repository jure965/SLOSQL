# SLOSQL
This is a project that enables you to write SQL in your favorite language.

Ever seen code like:
```
SELECT ime FROM tabela WHERE uporabnik = 'Janez';
```
Try to pronounce it in your head. Sounds weird right? Here's even more exagerated query:
```
SELECT magaca FROM taula WHERE brukernavn = 'Janez';
```
So I decided that I'm done with language mixing. This project will enable you to write like this:
```
IZBERI ime IZ tabela KJER uporabnik = 'Janez';
```
No more stupid weirdness...

By all means, this is just a joke with a grain of seriousness. BUT, if shit gets a lot of attention, I might make a SLOSQL preprocessor, that in the long run will support many languages and also different SQL variants/dialects.
